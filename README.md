Passive infrared sensor (PIR sensor) is a common sensor that can measure infrared (IR) light emitted by objects in its field of view. Simply put, it will receive infrared radiation emitted from the body, thereby detecting the movement of people and other animals. More specifically, it tells the main control board that someone has entered your room.
