# ESP32 PIR Motion Detection System

**Course:** ENGR 4321 Microcontrollers & Embedded Systems  
**Student:** Austin Davisson  
**Date:** February 2026  

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a motion detection system using an ESP32 DevKit V1 and a PIR sensor. When motion is detected, an LED is activated to indicate movement.

## Hardware Components (Simulated)
- ESP32 DevKit V1
- PIR Motion Sensor
- LED
- Resistor

## How It Works
The ESP32 continuously monitors the PIR sensor output. When the sensor detects motion, it sends a HIGH signal to the ESP32, which turns on the LED. When no motion is detected, the LED remains off.
